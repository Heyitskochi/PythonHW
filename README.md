### Total Number of Months

I used the length of "allmonths" to calculate the number of months

###  Net Total Amount of "Profit/Losses" 

I declared a variable called totalamount and added the amount of the current month to it 

I used a for loop to go through all the months

### Average in Changes

I declared a variable called "changeamounts" which will hold the sum of the changes

Inside the for loop, I declared two variables, "currentmonth" and "nextmonth"

To find the change I subtracted the "nextmonth[1]" by  "currentmonth[1]" then added that amount to "changeamounts"

I then divided "changeamounts" by "numberofmonths" -1 to calculate the average

### Greatest Increase & Greatest Decrease

Declared 4 empty variables
